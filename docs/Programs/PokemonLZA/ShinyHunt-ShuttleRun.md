### Instructions/Hunt Routes

### Alpha Pidgeot

Fast travel to Hibernal Pokemon Center, take the elevator nearby and get to the roof. Walk to the bench on the left side and stand right before the bench, facing where the building alpha Pidgeot would spawn. You may need to adjust a bit for the direction angel to make sure you won't either fall off or get blocked while running back and forth. You can also do a bench sit here, which will automatically calibrate and correct the position.
