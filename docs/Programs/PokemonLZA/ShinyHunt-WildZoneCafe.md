# Shiny Hunt - Wild Zone Café (beta testing, not available yet)

See also: [Shiny Hunting Recommendations](ShinyHuntRecommendations.md)

## Program Description

Shiny hunt by repeatedly fast traveling to one of the two in-wild-zone cafés. This will shiny hunt all spawns within 50m of the café entrance. Unlike blind macros, this program will tolerate the day/night cycle and will detect audible shinies that are nearby.

With the Shiny Charm you will get a shiny Pokémon quite fast if there are many Pokémon spawned around the entrance. Don't let the program run for too long or have old shinies overwritten by new ones.

This program would detect the day/night change. When such change occurs, the program would try to recover after the cutscene.

Shiny sound detection will happen at most once to avoid detecting the same shiny Pokémon over and over.


### Instructions

1. Fast travel to Café Bataille in Wild Zone 6 or Café Ultimo in Wild Zone 15.
2. Start the program in the game.


### Hunt Guide

Check the maps from [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/lumiosecity/) and [game8](https://game8.co/games/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A/archives/557774) to know what Pokémon are near the Cafés.

**WARNING**: there is a bug in how the game stores shiny Pumpkaboo in Wild Zone 15 near Café Ultimo ([Video](https://youtu.be/xf9PpqWtCds?t=325)).

In most cases the game stores up to 10 shinies internally so players won't lose a shiny if they leave the shiny hunting area or time of day changes.
But if a shiny Pumpkaboo in Wild Zone 15 is near the player when time of day changes, that shiny Pumpkaboo will not be stored internally. It is lost.

When using this program, don't aim to shiny hunt Pumpkaboo in Wild Zone 15. You can still shiny hunt other spawns like the alpha medium-variety Gourgeist, alpha Beedrill and alpha Banette. If you aim to shiny hunt Pumpkaboo with the current program, make sure you stop the program before any day/night change.


## Options

### Café

Pick which Café you are hunting.

### Shiny Sound Detected Action

When a shiny sound is heard, perform one of the following actions:

- Stop program and go Home. Send notification.
- Keep running. Notify on first shiny sound only. (default)
