### Instructions

1. Train a strong steel type Pokémon that can defeat Jacinthe's high-level fairy type Pokémon. We recommend Metagross (see below).
2. Stand facing Jacinthe in Hotel Richissime with Button A icon visible.
3. Select the strong Pokémon in party so it will lead the battle.
4. Start the program in the game.

This program has 2 modes: With and without a battle AI.

**With Battle AI:**

In this mode, the program will choose the move with the best type effectiveness against the opponents. In the event of a tie, they will chosen in this priority order:

- Top
- Left
- Right
- Bottom

**Without Battle AI (Blind Mash):**

In this mode, the program will use the 4 moves in the following priority:

- Top
- Left
- Right
- Bottom

In both modes, if your Pokémon faints, it will automatically timeout and switch to the next Pokémon in your party. The move priority is the same for all members of your party.

### Recommended Pokémon

- Metagross:
  - Lv. 100, full attack IV and EV, adamant nature. Hold Shell Bell.
  - Top move: Heavy Slam, left move: Earthquake. right move: Iron Head as a backup.
  - Heavy Slam one shots every Jacinthe's Pokémon except the after-DLC Mawile that's high level enough to withstand one Heavy Slam. Earthquake is to defeat that Mawile.
  - Before DLC, you can use the blind mashing mode to save a bit of time by spamming Heavy Slam. But after finishing DLC Jacinthe's team is upgraded to lv. 90+. We recommend using the battle AI mode to pick Heavy Slam or Earthquake according to detected type effectiveness.

\* Values are estimates with 3 Gold Canari Plush. Time estimates are taken from optimized runs with quick KOs and a single Pokémon  
\*\* DLC Jacinthe takes slightly longer to battle on average due to higher level Pokémon and needing to use Shell Bell

### Notes

- Check Jacinthe's battle team info [here](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jacinthe).

- Your party is healed automatically when starting the battle. No need to heal it beforehand.

- Due to randomness during battle, occasionally the program may fail to beat Jacinthe. The program will recover from the defeat and continue fighting her. Unlike the restaurants, it costs nothing to challenge her. So you won't lose money by leaving the program running unattended.

- Once the program fails the battle, the starting Pokémon may likely not be your strongest counter against Jacinthe any more, reducing farming efficiency until the counter becomes the starting Pokémon again. If you don't care about earning exp, you can bring only counter(s) in your party to address this.

- _Pay Day_ and _Make it Rain_ do not generate enough extra profit to offset the extra time it would take to use them
