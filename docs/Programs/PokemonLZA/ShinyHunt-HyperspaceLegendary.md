# Shiny Hunt - Hyperspace Legendary (In Development, Not Released Yet)

## Program Description

Automate various legendary Pokémon shiny hunting in their Hyperspace Wild Zones. It uses various shuttle run, teleportation, or game reset methods to hunt each legendary Pokémon accordingly. It resets the game if it runs out of calories. It stops when a shiny sound is detected, assuming it's from the legendary Pokémon.

Shiny huntable legendary Pokémon are Latias, Latios, Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion. Their wild zones can only found via special scans. Each special scan has the chance to spawn one of these five non-shiny-locked legendaries if it hasn't already been caught. Each legendary has its own unique setup required before starting the program.

Shiny odds for the legendaries are affected by the Shiny Charm and Sparkling Power donuts but the size and IVs are fixed.

Currently, only Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion are supported.

### Before You Start

- Know to use the backup save: the game places a backup save every time the player fast travels in Lumiose City (note: not in Hyperspace Lumiose). When loading the backup save, it places the player to the last Pokécenter where they talked to the nurse. If anything goes bad or you run out of time in a hyperspace, you can use the backup save to redo the hunt.

- The program resets the game when it runs out of calories. The calories you spent before saving the game in hyperspace are the calories the program cannot use to shiny hunt. Every fast travel in Hyperspace creates a save (but not a backup save). Be careful not to do unnecessary fast travels. If that happens, use the backup save to fix it.

- Be sure to use a 5-star Sparkling Power lv. 3 donut to give you good catch rate and high shiny rate. Use a donut with enough calories to be efficient in shiny hunting.

- Come prepared. Have a good team of Pokémon that can catch the legendary quickly. Have enough Pokéballs you want to catch it with.

## Options

### Shiny Sound Detected Action

When a shiny sound is heard, perform one of the following actions:

- Stop program and go Home. Send notification. (default)
- Keep running. Notify on first shiny sound only.
- Keep running. Notify on all shiny sounds.

The only option you should use is "Stop program and go Home." The other options are incompatible with soft-resets and exists only because this entire option block is shared with the other shiny hunting programs.

### Take a Video

Record a video of the encounter.

### Screenshot Delay

When a shiny is detected, wait this long before you take a screenshot and record a video. This will allow the screen to completely load before taking the screenshot.

### Legendary Pokémon

Which Legendary you are hunting.

### Minimum Cal. Reserved to Catch Legendary (Only For Hunting Sword of Justice)

Minimum amount of calories you need to catch the legendary after the program find it shiny. It burns 10 calories per second in those 5-star legendary Hyperspace Wild Zones.

The program will likely aggro the legendary, prepare enough time to fight it. Kill any other Pokémon following you first. Once you defeat the legendary, save in front of it and use the [Post-Kill Catcher](PostKillCatcher.md) program to catch it. If you prefer to save before battling it, start with a higher calorie limit to have more time to leave the area and drop aggro, save, and return to battle it.
