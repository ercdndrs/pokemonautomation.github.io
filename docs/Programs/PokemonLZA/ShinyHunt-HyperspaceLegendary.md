# Shiny Hunt - Hyperspace Legendary (Currently In Development. Not Released to Public Yet)

## Program Description

Shiny hunt Latias, Latios, Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion from 5-Star special scans by continuously respawning the legendary and checking when calories are low.

Each special scan has the chance to spawn one of these five non-shiny-locked legendaries if it hasn't already been caught. Each legendary has its own unique setup that's required before starting the program.

Shiny odds for the legendaries are affected by the Shiny Charm and Sparkling Power donuts but the size and IVs are fixed.
