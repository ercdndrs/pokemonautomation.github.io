### Instructions

1. Make sure is day time (no matter is late in the day or not)
2. Wrap to Zone 14
3. Start the program

Program will begin by restarting the day, while looking for the perfect conditions (Clear or Sunny day)

## Options

### How many cycles before stopping. 0 for never stop.

Choose for how long the program should run. With 0 it will run until you stop it.

A cycle is a "day change" in game, and the number of resets on a single day depends on if the weather will change before night. 

After every run inside the Zone 14, the program validates if the weather still valid, if is not, it will go to the Pokémon Center and reset until it find the right one (Clear or Sunny day).

Since before you even hear a shiny Helioptile you are going to hear hundreds of other Pokémon, the program do NOT rely on shiny sound. 

There's always the risk of, if kept running endlessly, a shiny Helioptile would be overwrite by another shiny if the 10 limit cap is reach. So it's up to you


## Recommendation
Turn the Status Notification on, if you have it enable on discord. This notification takes a screenshot in a position where one of the Helioptile spawn is visible, so if you are lucky you will be able to see the shiny there.
